# PersonalPortfolioWebsite
Personal portfolio website for my Intro To Web Applications Class

This is my Part 1 for my website. I left in the contact stuff from the theme that I used. It doesnt work and I will take out all of the code that does contact stuff when we start to use php.

I will also try to add all of the paralax effects on part 2.

Theme that I used: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/

I have never put a website on github before so let me know if ther are any issues.
